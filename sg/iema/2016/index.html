                Tech2Cool was founded in 2011 and markets computer hardware accessories and peripherals to
                individual consumers and businesses through their website. To date, the Singaporean startup has
                expanded their portfolio to more than 45 brands and have serviced customers from 24 countries
                outside of the city-state.<br /><br />

                When asked about their secret in keeping their customers happy, Prasenjit said that it is vital to
                personalize their service according to their specific needs. “We acknowledge every order personally
                and take end-to-end owner of every shipment until it is delivered. We ensure that we only sell new
                products and for every warranty request, we liaise directly with the manufacturers’ Authorized Service
                Providers. Though these efforts can be time consuming, we believe this is vital in creating happy and
                loyal customers”<br /><br />

                Other finalists for the Quality Award was Faire Belle, an e-commerce that markets a wide range of
                fashionable and high quality products and Falconpev, a specialist electric scooter and electric bicycle
                company. For the Popularity Award category, Lazada and Zalora both took finalist positions for
                Singapore.<br /><br />
