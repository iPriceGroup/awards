                  With the assistance of Trusted Company, each vote was validated and allowed to be casted only once.
                  The voting and nomination period began on 15th November 2016 and ended on 31st January 2017. All
                  merchants in Southeast Asia were automatically enlisted and qualified for the voting session.<br /><br />
                  Winners of the inaugural iEMA included BloomThis, winning the regional iPrice Special Awards while
                  Livlola, won the Quality Award for Malaysia and Lazada won Popularity Award for Malaysia. Present to

                  category.<br /><br />

            <div class="description">
                The iPrice Special Award category was created to recognize startups, or notable business efforts that
                made a significant impact in the e-commerce sector. Founded with his wife Penny Choo, the inception
                of BloomThis was the result of the couple’s passion to help others create beautiful moments with
                flowers. The startup entered into the e-commerce space with an ambition to make flower gifting
                accessible and convenient for consumers.<br /><br />
                When asked about their future plans, Lim explained that the floral industry has been slow to adopt e-commerce in the past decade. “Our plans in the pipeline is to further refine the technological aspect of
                BloomThis and offer a greater experience to more consumers. The gap we observed with the flower
                gifting experience is still big and we intend to bridge that by leveraging e-commerce to ensure that it
                remains a joyful experience for your loved ones”<br /><br />
                First runner up to the special award was Althea, an e-commerce company which was founded to make
                Korean beauty products accessible and affordable to consumers across the Southeast Asia region. The
                award’s panel of judges chose Althea as they have established themselves as great role model
                displaying how e-commerce can be an effective tool to meet specific consumer needs with a niche
                product.<br /><br />
                Malaysian based, BMS Organics, was selected for the second runner up position for their efforts to
                encourage the consumption of organic food and healthy living in an affordable manner. Combining
                both their online and offline assets, BMS Organics has been instrumental in educating consumers on
                organic food, environmental protection and dietary knowledge across Malaysia.<br /><br />
