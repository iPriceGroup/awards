                  <h3>For Immediate Release</h3>
                  <strong>Singapore, March 9 th , 2017—</strong>
                  E-commerce heavyweight Lazada, smartphone brand Starmobile
                  alongside 24 e-commerce merchants in Southeast Asia were honoured at the inaugural iPrice E-
                  Commerce Merchant Awards (iEMA) 2016 at the eTail Asia Conference in Marina Bay Sands, Singapore.
                  Voted and nominated by tens of thousands of consumers across Southeast Asia, the awards were
                  organized by iPrice Group in partnership with eTail Asia, Trusted Company and UseInsider, with the aim
                  to celebrate and honour the efforts of Southeast Asia’s top e-commerce merchants in the booming
                  industry.<br /><br />

                  With the assistance of Trusted Company, each vote was validated and allowed to be casted only once.
                  The voting and nomination period began on 15th November 2016 and ended on 31st January 2017. All
                  merchants in Southeast Asia were automatically enlisted and qualified for the voting session.<br /><br />

                  Winners of the inaugural iEMA included Lazada, winning the Popularity Award for the Philippines and
                  Starmobile won the Quality Award for the Philippines.<br /><br />

                  “Thank you for your support and trust in making Lazada a customer-first company and one of SEA's
                  most loved e-commerce brands,” said Sydney Dondon, senior associate of affiliate marketing of Lazada
                  Philippines.<br /><br />

                  The Lazada Group was established in 2012 and operates Lazada, one of the largest e-commerce
                  platforms in Southeast Asia.<br /><br />

                  When asked about their future plans, Sydney explained that shopping experience and empowering
                  stakeholders were key. “We continuously improve the shopping experience by understanding what our customer needs, at every step of the shopping journey. It's really down to empowering our
                  stakeholder. We're adding features on the website and app so that our customers can make more
                  informed purchases. We are beefing up our logistics capabilities to fulfil orders faster wherever they
                  may be. We are also developing tools to make selling more efficient for our merchants,” said Sydney.<br /><br />

                  Starmobile, a smartphone brand from the Philippines won the Quality Award for the Philippines. From
                  its humble beginnings in 2011, it was no surprise that Starmobile took home the award for Quality
                  considering them being known for being one of the most innovative smartphone brands locally and
                  their strong fan base on social media.<br /><br />

                  Finalists for the Quality Award were Benloi, an online sporting equipment company and Anson’s, an
                  appliance and electronics store in the Philippines.
